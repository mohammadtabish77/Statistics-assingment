    "**Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "- Mean\n",
    "- Median\n",
    "- Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean:** The mean is the average of all values in a dataset. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Median:** The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers than the mean.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mode:** The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). The mode can be used for both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures provide different perspectives on the central tendency of a dataset, helping to understand where most values are concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Height data: [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",

    "- **Mean:** Sum all values and divide by the number of values.\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Mean} = \\frac{178 + 177 + 176 + \\ldots + 176.5}{16} = 177.8125\n",

    "- **Median:** Arrange data in ascending order and find the middle value.\n",
    "  Sorted data: [172.5, 175, 175, 176, 176, 176.2, 177, 177, 177, 178, 178, 178, 178.2, 178.9, 179, 180]\n",
    "  Median = 177 (the 8th value in sorted list)\n",

    "- **Mode:** The mode is the most frequent value in the dataset.\n",
    "  Mode = 178 (appears 4 times)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data: [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It is calculated as the square root of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, calculate the mean (already found in Q3):\n",
    "  Mean = 177.8125\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the variance:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Variance} = \\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\text{Mean})^2}{n-1}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  Calculate squared differences for each value, sum them, and divide by \\( n-1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, take the square root to find the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion quantify how spread out the values in a dataset are from the central tendency measures (mean, median, mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a simple measure of spread.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Variance measures the average squared difference of each value from the mean, while standard deviation is the square root of variance. They provide a more precise measure of dispersion, accounting for all data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider two datasets of test scores:\n",
    "Dataset A: [75, 80, 85, 90, 95]\n",
    "Dataset B: [60, 70, 85, 90, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range:\n",
    "  - Dataset A: Range = 95 - 75 = 20\n",
    "  - Dataset B: Range = 100 - 60 = 40\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance and Standard Deviation:\n",
    "  - Calculate for each dataset to compare the spread of scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What is a Venn diagram?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a visual representation used to show the relationships between sets or groups of objects. It consists of overlapping circles or other shapes, where each circle represents a set and the overlap represents common elements between sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. For the two given sets A = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} & B = {0, 2, 6, 8, 10}, find:**\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) **A ∩ B** (intersection - elements common to both sets):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   A \\cap B = \\{2, 6\\}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) **A ⋃ B** (union - all elements from both sets, without duplicates):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   A \\cup B = \\{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness in data refers to the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data points around the mean. It indicates whether the data distribution is skewed to the left (negative skewness), skewed to the right (positive skewness), or symmetric (zero skewness).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If data is right-skewed (positive skewness), it means that there are more values concentrated on the left side of the distribution, with a long tail extending to the right. In this case:\n",
    "- The mean will be greater than the median because the presence of outliers or higher values on the right side of the distribution pulls the mean towards higher values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Covariance:** Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables (positive, negative, or no relationship). However, it does not indicate the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation:** Correlation is a standardized measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis, covariance and correlation are used to understand relationships between variables, assess the strength and direction of associations, and make predictions based on observed patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a dataset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample mean (\\( \\bar{X} \\)) is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values (n):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum X_i}{n} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example calculation:\n",
    "Dataset: [10, 15, 12, 18, 20]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{10 + 15 + 12 + 18 + 20}{5} = \\frac{75}{5} = 15 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the sample mean for this dataset is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a normal distribution:\n",
    "- The mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "- This symmetry is a characteristic feature of the normal distribution, where the data is evenly distributed around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Covariance:** Measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is affected by the scale of the variables and can range from negative infinity to positive infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation:** Standardized measure that quantifies both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. They can skew measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Central Tendency:** Outliers can pull the mean away from the typical center of the data, making it less representative of the dataset compared to the median or mode.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dispersion:** Outliers can increase the range and standard deviation of the dataset, indicating higher variability than actually present in the main body of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset of incomes for a small group:\n",
    "[30, 32, 31, 33, 32, 30, 31, 32, 500]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean without outlier:** (30 + 32 + 31 + 33 + 32 + 30 + 31 + 32) / 8 = 31.125\n",
    "- **Mean with outlier:** (30 + 32 + 31 + 33 + 32 + 30 + 31 + 32 + 500) / 9 = 79.56\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is greatly affected by the outlier (500), whereas the median and mode remain relatively unchanged.\n",
