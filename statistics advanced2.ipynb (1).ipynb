    "**Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Mathematically, it is defined as \\( P(X = x) \\), where \\( X \\) is the random variable and \\( x \\) is a specific value of \\( X \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:** Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of this die is:\n",
    "  - \\( P(X = 1) = P(X = 2) = P(X = 3) = P(X = 4) = P(X = 5) = P(X = 6) = \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** PDF is used for continuous random variables and represents the relative likelihood of the random variable taking on a particular value. The probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values is given by the integral of the PDF over that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:** The PDF of a normal distribution \\( N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\) is given by:\n",
    "  - \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\),\n",
    "  where \\( \\mu \\) is the mean and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cumulative Density Function (CDF):** CDF gives the probability that a random variable \\( X \\) takes on a value less than or equal to \\( x \\). For a discrete random variable, it is defined as \\( F(x) = P(X \\leq x) \\), and for a continuous random variable, it is \\( F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( f(t) \\) is the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:** For a standard normal distribution \\( N(0, 1) \\), the CDF \\( \\Phi(x) \\) is:\n",
    "  - \\( \\Phi(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-t^2/2} \\, dt \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "  CDF is used to determine the probability of a random variable taking on values less than or equal to a specified value \\( x \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is used in situations where data tends to cluster around a central value with no bias to left or right, and it is symmetrical. Examples include:\n",
    "- Heights and weights of people in a population.\n",
    "- Measurement errors.\n",
    "- Test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of the normal distribution:\n",
    "- **Mean (μ):** Determines the center or location of the distribution.\n",
    "- **Standard deviation (σ):** Determines the spread or width of the distribution. A larger standard deviation means the data points are spread out over a wider range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importance:** The normal distribution is important because of the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means (or sums) from independent random variables approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the original distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:** Real-life examples include:\n",
    "  - IQ scores in a population.\n",
    "  - Blood pressure measurements.\n",
    "  - Monthly temperatures in a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Distribution:** It is a discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability \\( p \\) and the value 0 with probability \\( 1 - p \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:** A single coin flip (1 for heads, 0 for tails) with probability \\( p \\) of landing heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difference:**\n",
    "  - **Bernoulli Distribution:** Describes the outcome of a single trial (success or failure).\n",
    "  - **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a normal distribution \\( N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\):\n",
    "- \\( \\mu = 50 \\)\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma = 10 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find \\( P(X > 60) \\):\n",
    "1. Standardize \\( X = 60 \\) using the z-score formula:\n",
    "   \\( Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look up the probability from the standard normal distribution table or use a calculator:\n",
    "   \\( P(Z > 1) \\approx 0.1587 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is approximately \\( 0.1587 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7: Explain Uniform Distribution with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniform Distribution:** It is a continuous probability distribution where every value within a certain range is equally likely to occur. The PDF of a uniform distribution \\( U(a, b) \\) is \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\) for \\( a \\leq x \\leq b \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:** Rolling a fair six-sided die, where each outcome (1 through 6) has an equal probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-score:** The z-score (or standard score) measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated as \\( Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\), where \\( X \\) is the value, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importance:** Z-score allows us to standardize and compare different sets of data on a common scale. It helps in understanding how unusual or typical a data point is in relation to the rest of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean (or sum) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the variables, if the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significance:** The CLT is significant because it allows us to make inferences about population parameters based on sample statistics. It forms the basis for many statistical tests and methods, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are:\n",
    "- The sample consists of independent observations.\n",
    "- The sample size is sufficiently large (typically \\( n \\geq 30 \\)).\n",
    "- The variables from which the samples are drawn have a finite variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions ensure that the sample mean (or sum) approximates a normal distribution, making statistical inference more reliable.\n",
